# Objective

The objective of this project is to:

-   Be simple yet complete.
-   Show and stimulate the use of C++ and OOP.
-   Have fun :D.

## Simple yet complete

<p align="justify">
Story time: I was developing <a href="https://github.com/murilobnt/vulnus">vulnus</a>: A
C++ SFML 2D platform game. Things were going pretty well and, currently, I have
a functional simple level, where you can walk around, shoot, jump and teleport.
There is enemies and even time mechanics (Morning, afternoon, evening and
night), including the day of the week. Everything was going alright, until I
needed to change the game to another level, or scene. As the code was, I was
completely lost and I couldn't find a way to figure how to do it **without
having to change the whole project structure**. Since that was the only way to
do it, I did it. And, from what I did, I created this project. **If I had GS2D
before, I wouldn't have to go through all that, and the game would've be way
more cleaner and advanced**.
</p>

## Show and stimulate the use of C++ and OOP

<p align="justify">
It's not uncommon to see graduation programs that teach C/C++ in their "initial"
courses. And, as I've heard in graduation, people find C++ and Java difficult
programming languages. I mean, it takes some time until you begin to like and
really understand pointers, and who doesn't get scared by *public static void
main(String[] args)* when they see it the first time?

GS2D helps to **focus on smaller chunks of code**. Maybe the most difficult part
is to write a class and inherit from others (*winks at Java*), but this is
**worth to learn**. So, with that knowledge, the programmer will only have to
deal with some "small" procedures. **It's more organized, expansible and
*simple***.
</p>

## Have fun :D

<p align="justify">
Why is some hard games so good to play? **Challenge: It makes you feel good when
you overcome hard obstacles**. Deep down, games want you to win and play, to
make you have fun and get better with it. This is what I aim to do with this
engine. C++, OOP and game development are somewhat difficult, but if you manage
to use them for a game of yours, wouldn't you feel great? **This engine wants to
be a balancing to the difficult of the three points I've listed**.
