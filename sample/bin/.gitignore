# All worlds begin in darkness, and all so end. The heart is no different.
# Darkness sprouts within it, it grows, consumes it. Such is its nature.
# In the end, every heart returns to the darkness whence it came!
# You see, darkness is the heart's true essence.

# You want to use it, fine by me. I got it for myself, but how many
# ways can you write "Made a sword today?"
