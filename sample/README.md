# Sample GS2D Game

This is a sample game developed using the GS2D Framework and SFML.

## How to run

Read [this file](https://github.com/murilobnt/gs2d/blob/master/.github/installation/installation_sudo.md#check-if-the-sample-is-working).

## Fast explanation

The levels were created with [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/). Everything must be saved as .json (even tileset files) if you use a gs::TiledLevel object.
