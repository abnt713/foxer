# Sample Foxer Game

This is a sample game developed using the Foxer Framework.

## How to run

Read [this file](https://github.com/murilobnt/foxer/blob/master/.github/installation/installation-sudo.md#check-if-the-sample-is-working).

## Fast explanation

The levels were created with [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/). Everything must be saved as .json (even tileset files) if you use a fox::TiledLevel object.
