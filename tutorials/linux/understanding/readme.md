# Tutorial - Understanding some concepts

Oh, hello, fellow owl. In this tutorial, we will look to some
core concepts about this project.

Here are the concepts we will be exploring here.

   * C++ programming.
   * Object Oriented Programming (OOP).
   * Making applications with SFML.

## C++ programming

It's desired that you know some things about C++ before using this engine. T
hose are concepts it's important for you to know.

   * C++ syntax. [HELP!](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/index.htm)
   * Data structures. [HELP!](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22579697/what-is-a-stack-queue-vector-array-and-list)
   * Header and source code separation. [HELP!](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9579930/separating-class-code-into-a-header-and-cpp-file)
   * Classes. [HELP!](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_classes_objects.htm)
   * Pointers and memory. [HELP!](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_pointers.htm)

If you know that, you might not run into much problem... I guess ^^.

## Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

I love OOP. I can list a lot of advantages (and disadvantages) of it, but the 
main reason I love it is because your code is less likely to become one big
crumpled piece of paper. If you like to organize stuff, then OOP is for you :D.

Those are the concepts we'd like to know.

   * Encapsulation. [HELP!](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_data_encapsulation.htm)
   * Inheritance. [HELP!](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_inheritance.htm)
   * Polymorphism (it might sound scary if you don't know what it is, but it's really beautiful to see it working :D). [HELP!](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1031273/what-is-polymorphism-what-is-it-for-and-how-is-it-used)

There might be some other things, but those are the ones I recall right now.

## SFML

SFML is a nice multimedia library. Here's what you need to know about it.

   * [SFML Start](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.0/start-linux.php).
   * [SFML Documentation](https://www.sfml-dev.org/documentation/2.0/).

Always go there if you don't know something about it.
