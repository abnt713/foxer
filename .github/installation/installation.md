# Installation

## Installation without sudo

If you don't have sudo permissions, you should read [this file](https://github.com/murilobnt/gs2d_engine/blob/master/.github/installation/installation-without-sudo.md).

But beware: This installation guide will only work if you already have
GCC installed in your machine. Otherwise, it won't be able to help
you about it.
